This repositery provides WebScraping example using Jupyter
##Do you know Jupyter?
Jupiter is an open-source that provides a web-based interactive computing environment where you can create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
It's widely used in data science, scientific computing, machine learning, and many other fields.
##Key Features of Jupyter

###Interactive Notebooks:
Jupyter Notebooks are documents that can contain both code (in various programming languages like Python, R, Julia, etc.) and rich text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, links, etc.).

###Code Execution:
You can write and execute code in a notebook, with the results displayed inline. This is useful for testing, debugging, and visualizing code outputs.

###Data Visualization:
Jupyter supports various data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh, making it easy to create interactive plots and graphs.

###Documentation and Narratives:
You can include narrative text, equations (using LaTeX), and images to document your work and create comprehensive, reproducible analyses.

###Language Support:
While Jupyter is most commonly associated with Python, it supports over 40 programming languages through different "kernels."
